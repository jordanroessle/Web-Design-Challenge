# Web-Design-Challenge

This application includes 7 pages. 
The home page includes an explanation of the project and 4 working images that when clicked take the user to large visualizations of the clicked graph.

The four visualization pages contain a large image of a graph as well as a description of what is shown in the graph.

The comparisons page gives 4 large graphs of each graph in order to allow the user to compare them easily. 
The large graphs can be clicked on to route to the visualization pages mentioned above.

Finally, the last page includes a responsive table with all of the data used in our analysis. 

Also included on every page is a navigation bar that includes a link to the home page, a dropdown menu to get each visualization page, and links to the comparisons and data pages.
